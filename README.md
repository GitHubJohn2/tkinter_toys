The reason TB4 has been removed is, to be honest, that it was a miss – for a couple of reasons. First, the concept turned out to have two very different markets. The first “market” was early learners, usually of high school age. The second, more advanced users who already have an solid exposure to tkinter and want a quick, complete, condensed reference.
For the first group a new 1 sheet (front and back – 2 pages) toolbox, TB5, has introduced with the title “tkinter Toys: Starter Set”. It has been designed to support an introductory 4 to 5 day ciriculum as part of a high school technology segment.
The second, TB6, is an eight page highly condensed reference covering all the bases we can, including full table refrences to all attributes, options, methods and commands including listings of all the window manager methods and winfo methods. Version 1 has been posted. Your comments are solicited and appreciated.
